# test_driven_development
In which I go through Harry Percival's excellent book,
Test Driven Development with Python, available from O'Reilly.

If you're interested in learning how to do proper unit and functionality 
tests, especially if you want to learn some Django along the way, this
book is a great way to go.

Buy it!
